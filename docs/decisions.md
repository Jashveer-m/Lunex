# Phase 1 decisions

## Router: chi

`net/http`'s `ServeMux` can do method+path patterns since Go 1.22, but it has no
middleware chaining and no route groups. Phase 1 already needs three different
middleware stacks on one tree (global, rate-limited auth endpoints,
token-protected endpoints), and later phases add more. chi gives that with a
`http.Handler`-compatible API and no framework lock-in: every handler is still a
plain `http.HandlerFunc`, so dropping chi later is a routing-file change, not a
rewrite. It has one dependency (itself) and no reflection or codegen.

## Migrations: golang-migrate, as a library

Migration files live in `backend/migrations/` in golang-migrate's standard
`{version}_{name}.{up|down}.sql` format. They are embedded into the binary with
`go:embed`, and applied by `cmd/migrate` (or on boot with `AUTO_MIGRATE=true`).

Embedding rather than shelling out to the `migrate` CLI means a deploy carries
its own schema and there is no separate tool version to keep in sync — and, in
practice, it is why `make migrate-up` works on a machine that has never
installed golang-migrate.

## Password hashing: Argon2id

`golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` with the OWASP-recommended parameters (19 MiB,
t=2, p=1, 16-byte salt, 32-byte key). Hashes are stored in the standard PHC
string, which carries its own parameters:

```
$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$<salt>$<hash>
```

Because the parameters travel with each hash, raising the cost later does not
invalidate existing passwords: old hashes keep verifying with their recorded
parameters, and rehash-on-login can upgrade them.

## Refresh tokens: hashed with SHA-256, not Argon2id

Refresh tokens are 256 bits from `crypto/rand`. Unlike a password, there is no
dictionary to grind, so a memory-hard KDF buys nothing — and it would turn every
refresh into 19 MiB of work, which is a denial-of-service lever on an endpoint
that unauthenticated clients can call. SHA-256 is the right primitive for a
high-entropy secret. The database only ever sees the hash.

## Rotation is a single UPDATE

`SessionRepository.Rotate` swaps the hash in one `UPDATE ... WHERE
refresh_token_hash = $1 AND expires_at > now() RETURNING ...`. Two concurrent
uses of the same token cannot both succeed — the second matches zero rows — so
replay fails without needing a transaction or an advisory lock. Rotation keeps
the same session row, which preserves `device_info` and `created_at` across the
lifetime of a login.

## Logout does not revoke outstanding access tokens

Access tokens are stateless JWTs, so an already-issued one stays valid until it
expires — at most 15 minutes after logout. Checking a denylist on every request
would trade the main benefit of stateless tokens for a database round trip per
call. The 15-minute TTL is the mitigation. If Phase 2 needs immediate
revocation, the cheapest addition is a `token_version` column on `users`
included as a JWT claim and compared on parse.

## Uniform login failures

An unknown email and a wrong password return the same `401 invalid_credentials`.
The unknown-email path still runs a full Argon2id hash so the two cases are not
distinguishable by timing either.

## Email uniqueness is case-insensitive

The unique index is on `lower(email)` and the application lowercases before
writing, so `Ada@Example.com` and `ada@example.com` cannot both register.

# Explicitly deferred

These are **not** silently skipped — they are known gaps in Phase 1.

## 1. Rate limiting is in-process, not distributed

`internal/auth/ratelimit.go` implements a real per-IP token bucket
(`golang.org/x/time/rate`) that is wired into `/auth/register` and
`/auth/login`, so the endpoints are not unprotected. But:

- Counters live in process memory: they reset on restart.
- Each replica keeps its own buckets, so behind N API processes the effective
  limit is N x the configured rate.
- The limiter keys on `RemoteAddr` only. `X-Forwarded-For` is deliberately
  ignored, because it is client-controlled until a trusted proxy is configured;
  behind a load balancer this needs a trusted-proxy setting, or every request
  will appear to come from the balancer.

A shared store (Redis) is the fix, and Redis is explicitly out of scope for
Phase 1. The `TODO(phase-2)` comment sits on the type.

## 2. No auth UI

`frontend/` is a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold that renders a
health panel and nothing else. There is no login form, no token storage, no
routing, and `src/lib/api.ts` only wires `/healthz`. The brief made the UI
optional for this phase; the auth screens belong with the token-storage decision
(memory + refresh cookie vs. localStorage), which is a Phase 2 call.

## 3. No email verification or password reset

`users` has no `email_verified_at` column and nothing sends mail. Registration
trusts the address as given.

## 4. Refresh tokens are returned in the JSON body

Not as an `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite` cookie. That is the right shape for the
API-client and mobile-free scope of Phase 1, but a browser SPA storing a refresh
token in JavaScript-reachable storage is XSS-exposed. Revisit with the auth UI.

## 5. No CORS middleware

The frontend dev server proxies `/api` to the backend (see
`frontend/vite.config.ts`), so same-origin holds in development. A deployment
that serves the SPA from a different origin will need CORS configured.
